# Whats Next?!
This app is a joint project between Firuze and Henning. Our goal is to solve an issue we have several times a week: What do we eat?

We came up with the idea to collect all our meals that we cooked or want to cook in an app. When ever we ask ourselves the question during the week we can ask the app to suggest us something.
